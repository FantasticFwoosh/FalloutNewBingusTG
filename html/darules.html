## The Rules Of Da Wasteland
**We don't really run off complex rules here, they're pretty standard.**

 1. Don't be GENUINELY racist/misogynistic/homophobic, etc. Things said as a joke, sure, aren't gonna catch you anything bad, but spamming them relentlessly or saying this kinda shit *with malice* will probably have some dudes on your ass about it and will probably end up in a mute/ban if it continues. We all say the classic edgy jokes, as long as they stay jokes and you realize that shit isn't cool with meaning behind it then we gucci.

 2. **NO ERP**. Yeah. Fuck ERP. There's plenty of high population F13 servers ~~(and by that I mean two)~~ that is rife with ERP, but I'm not having you dress up as a fucking mutated khajit and mime out sucking off a bird person in this server - shit is cringe and if I see that in my logs you're getting a perma-ban. Saying that, if you type something like "let me devour your ass" to a passerby, I'm not going to seek you out and shit in your eyes. Like I said, **jokes are a-okay**, but the minute you start rubbing one out on my server my *GOD* will I delete you off the face of this earth.
 
 3. Try to treat eachother well - I'm not going to stop a raid, I'm not going to give people shit back for the sake of "please don't be upset !!!" but if you're beating the shit out of some guy who's just trying to learn how to play F13 then, come on bruh, pick someone more robust.
 
 4. ~~feet pics for admin :^)~~ 

This is probably a good time to mention that the server will be in constant and heavy development for a little bit of time, so expect a few server restarts where it isn't convenient here and there, I'll be sure to let you know before anything happens through the OOC chat.
